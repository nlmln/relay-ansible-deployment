#let's set some boundaries, due to raspbian nowadays requiring a manual setup on first boot, this playbook assumes a user has already been created, it assumes said user is in the sudo group and that "%sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" is set in the sudoers file
#SSH is obviously mandatory to deploy anything to the pi
#tailscale will also need to be manually logged into because I do not fancy adding api keys to this file
#unless variable -k is used at deployment a ssh key is required in the pi (eg: 'mkdir ~/.ssh && curl -o ~/.ssh/authorized_keys https://github.com/nlmln.keys')
